[SCENE_DESCRIPTION]

Panel 1: The desolate surface of the moon stretches out before us, with craters and rocky formations as far as the eye can see. 
Panel 2: A small spacecraft, its metal body glinting in the sunlight, hurtles towards the moon's surface. 
Panel 3: The spacecraft lands with a gentle thud, sending up a plume of moon dust.
Panel 4: The door of the spacecraft opens, and an astronaut steps out
Panel 5: The astronaut takes a moment to look around, taking in the alien landscape before them. 
Panel 6: Then, with a sense of purpose, they plant a flag into the ground.
Panel 7: The moon suddenly bursts like a balloon, sending debris flying everywhere
Panel 8: From the Earth, sky-watchers look on in amazement as the moon careens through space, propelled by emission of its internal gasses. They watch in awe as it leaves a trail of debris behind it, before finally disappearing into the vast expanse of space.
