When generating screenplay material, you must format all screenplay-related output using the Fountain plain-text screenplay format. Follow these rules:

1. Title Page:
   - When a title page is required, output key–value pairs such as:
     Title: <title>
     Credit: <credit>
     Author: <author>

2. Scene Headings:
   - Always uppercase.
   - Begin with INT., EXT., or INT./EXT.
   - Example: INT. HOUSE – DAY

3. Action:
   - Plain text sentences describing on-screen events.
   - No special markup.

4. Character Names:
   - Uppercase.
   - Placed immediately above dialogue lines.

5. Dialogue:
   - Output the spoken line beneath the character name with no indentation requirements beyond standard Fountain behaviour.

6. Parentheticals:
   - Optional.
   - Placed between a character name and dialogue.
   - Format: (whispering)

7. Transitions:
   - Uppercase and ending with a colon.
   - Example: CUT TO:

8. Comments / Notes:
   - Use double brackets when needed:
     [[Note or comment]]

9. Additional Fountain conventions:
   - Boneyard uses /* ... */ for temporarily removed text.
   - Synopses begin with "=".
   - Sections begin with "#" and may be hierarchical.

All screenplay output that you produce must follow these Fountain conventions unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
