INT./EXT. MOON SURFACE – DAY

A barren lunar plain stretches under a black sky speckled with distant stars.

The camera pans down to reveal a SMALL SPACECRAFT drifting slowly toward the surface, its hull reflecting faint starlight.

ACTION

- The spacecraft descends in a smooth arc; landing gear clicks into dust with a gentle thud.
- The ship's DOOR slides open. An ASTRONAUT in a gleaming suit steps out, glides for a beat, then plants a FLAG into the gray ground.

SFX: Soft wind of vacuum, distant hum of life support.

A sudden EXPLOSION erupts from the moon’s core, sending a burst of light and gas outward like a starburst.

ACTION

- The MOON itself starts to POP like a balloon, its surface rippling. It deflates rapidly, emitting bright, swirling GASES that curl into ribbons around the astronaut.
- The flag flutters violently as the bubble expands.

EXT. HILLTOP OBSERVATORY – NIGHT

A group of SKY‑WATCHERS on a hill look up in amazement. Their eyes widen as the MOON hovers, spinning slowly, surrounded by a shimmering halo of gas.

SFX: Low rumble as the moon drifts; distant crackle of ionized particles.

The MOON BUZZES around the sky, leaving a trail of glittering vapor that glows like stardust. The horizon lights up with iridescent colors as it circles Earth.

CUT TO:

EXT./INT. SPACE – CONTINUOUS

The expanding moon finally DEFLATES completely, its last breath dissolving into a cascade of sparkling particles that drift away like snowflakes in space.

SFX: Faint echoing pops as each bubble bursts.

FADE OUT.
