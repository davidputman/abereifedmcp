[It was a dark and stormy night and the wind was blowing high. 

The evening before All Hallow's it was, Halloween as they have it. The most heavily haunted night of the year. The night when every unearthly and undead spectre, spook and spirit rises from their resting place and moves among the world of the living. 

Come with me now, as thunder shakes Mamgu's old house down to its foundations, and see the family huddled in the kitchen, sheltered from the storm. 

Protected there from the howling hubbub of the hurly-burly by the thickness of the walls so solid. Slabs of slate and stone standing steadfast on that self same spot for centuries, surviving numberless storms like but, perhaps never quite as severe as, this. 

What a terrible night," said Tadcu, "So windy, wild and wet. So full of ghosts and demons. We need a distraction to take our minds off of the devilish goings on outside. Entertainment is required!" 

He glanced askance at the cat lying on the table. 
\"Tabster! Spin us a yarn!\" 

Tabster looked up reluctantly. "I'll spin you a yarn," he whispered in hushed tones, "I'll tell you a story the likes of which is seldom said and certainly like you've never heard before. A story such that none that heard it would ever want to hear it's like again. A story of such dark and dastardly despicable deeds that its words madden any mouth that dares to mutter them and burns any ears with the misfortune to hear them." 

"But tell it to you I will" 

More thunder cracked directly above and when the rumbling had passed over, he quietly began. 
\"It was a dark and stormy night and the wind was blowing high."
