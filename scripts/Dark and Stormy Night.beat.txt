[INT. MAMGU'S OLD HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT]

It was a dark and stormy night and the wind was blowing high.

[The family huddles together in the kitchen, sheltered from the storm.]

TADCU
What a terrible night! So windy, wild and wet. So full of ghosts and demons. We need a distraction to take our minds off of the devilish goings on outside. Entertainment is required!

He glances at the cat lying on the table.

TADCU (CONT'D)
Tabster! Spin us a yarn!

TABSTER
I'll spin you a yarn. I'll tell you a story the likes of which is seldom said and certainly like you've never heard before. A story such that none that heard it would ever want to hear it's like again. A story of such dark and dastardly despicable deeds that its words madden any mouth that dares to mutter them and burns any ears with the misfortune to hear them.

TABSTER (CONT'D)
But tell it to you I will.

More thunder cracks directly above. When the rumbling has passed over, Tabster begins to speak in hushed tones.

TABSTER (CONT'D)
It was a dark and stormy night and the wind was blowing high.
The evening before All Hallow's it was, Halloween as they have it. The most heavily haunted night of the year. The night when every unearthly and undead spectre, spook and spirit rises from their resting place and moves among the world of the living.

Fade to black.
