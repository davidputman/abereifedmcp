**Prompt List – “A Moon Bubble”**

| Prompt (with Timing) |
|-----------------------|
| **0:00** – *Opening titles (animated title card)*: Show the film’s title sliding into view over a subtle lunar backdrop, with gentle glow and soft synth pads. |
| **0:05** – *Shot 1: Barren lunar plain under black sky*: Pan slowly across the silent gray terrain, stars glittering above; camera tilts up to reveal the vastness of space. |
| **0:10** – *Shot 2: Small spacecraft approaching moon, hull reflecting starlight*: The craft glides in, its metallic surface catching faint starlight; subtle thruster trails emphasize motion. |
| **0:12** – *Shot 3: Spacecraft landing gear clicks into dust*: Close‑up of wheels touching regolith, a brief dust puff, and the mechanical click echoing through vacuum. |
| **0:15** – *Shot 4: Astronaut exits, glides, plants flag on gray ground*: The astronaut steps out in slow motion, gliding with controlled movements before planting a flag that ripples gently. |
| **0:18** – *Shot 5: Sudden explosion from moon’s core (burst of light and gas)*: A sudden bright flash erupts at the center of the moon; gas streams outward like a starburst, illuminating nearby rocks. |
| **0:20** – *Shot 6: Moon begins to pop like a balloon, surface ripples and deflates*: The lunar surface bulges, cracks appear, and the moon slowly loses volume, emitting shimmering gases. |
| **0:25** – *Shot 7: Swirling gases curl into ribbons around astronaut; flag flutters violently*: Gas ribbons wrap around the astronaut’s suit; the flag twirls in a dramatic vortex. |
| **0:30** – *Shot 8: Hilltop observatory – sky‑watchers stare in amazement*: A panoramic view of an observatory hill with people pointing upward, their faces lit by the glowing moon as the lunar surface bulges, cracks appear, and the moon slowly loses volume, emitting shimmering gases.. |
| **0:35** – *Shot 9: Moon hovers, spinning slowly with shimmering halo of gas*: The partially deflated moon orbits Earth slowly, a luminous halo casting soft light on the hills below. |
| **0:40** – *Shot 10: Low rumble as moon drifts; ionized particles crackle*: A subtle low-frequency hum accompanies faint sparks of charged particles swirling around the moon’s edge. |
| **0:45** – *Shot 11: Moon buzzes around the sky, leaving glittering vapor trail*: The moon darts across the night, trailing sparkling vapor that glows like stardust against the dark sky. |
| **0:50** – *Shot 12: Horizon lights up with iridescent colors as moon circles Earth*: Earth's horizon blazes with shifting hues—purple, teal, and gold—as the moon’s glow bathes it. |
| **0:55** – *Shot 13: Space scene – expanding moon deflates completely*: In space, the moon’s remaining structure collapses into a shimmering bubble that pops one final time. |
| **0:57** – *Shot 14: Last breath dissolves into sparkling particles drifting like snowflakes*: A cascade of glittering particles floats away, gradually fading into darkness. |
| **1:00** – *Closing credits (animated credit roll)*: Credits roll over a subtle celestial background, with gentle music trailing off.

the moon drifts, faint sparks of charged particles swirling around the moon’s edge. The the moon buzzes around the sky, leaving glittering a vapor trail, it  darts across the night, trailing sparkling vapor that glows like stardust against the dark sky. The horizon lights up with iridescent colors as moon circles the Earth and Earth's horizon blazes with shifting hues—purple, teal, and gold—as the moon’s glow bathes it. 
Scene from space. The moon deflates completely, remaining structure collapses into a shimmering bubble that pops one final time above the Earth's atmosphere. It dissolves into sparkling particles drifting like snowflakes. A cascade of glittering particles floats away, gradually fading into darkness.
