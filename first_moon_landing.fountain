EXT. MOON SURFACE - DAY

The desolate surface of the moon stretches out before us, with craters and rocky formations as far as the eye can see. 
A small spacecraft, its metal body glinting in the sunlight, hurtles towards the moon's surface. 
The spacecraft lands with a gentle thud, sending up a plume of moon dust.

The door of the spacecraft opens, and an astronaut steps out, their suit a deep blue and their helmet reflecting the sun's rays. 
The astronaut takes a moment to look around, taking in the alien landscape before them. 
Then, with a sense of purpose, they plant a flag into the ground.

EXT. MOON SURFACE - DAY

But instead of celebrating this historic moment, the moon suddenly bursts like a balloon, sending debris flying everywhere. 
The astronaut is caught off guard, stumbling backward as the moon's surface erupts into chaos.

CUT TO:

SPACE - DAY

From the Earth, sky-watchers look on in amazement as the moon careens through space, 
propelled by emission of its internal gasses. They watch in awe as it leaves a trail 
of debris behind it, before finally disappearing into the vast expanse of space.
