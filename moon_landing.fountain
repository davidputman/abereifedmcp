# Moon Landing Script

Scene: The moon, with a spaceship approaching in the distance.

The camera pans over the desolate, rocky surface of the moon as we hear the sound of engines roaring in the distance (ROAR). The spaceship comes into view, and we watch as it slowly begins to descend towards the lunar surface.

The engines slow down, and the ship finally lands on the moon's surface with a gentle thud (THUD).

A door opens, and an astronaut jumps out of the ship, landing clumsily on the moon's surface. The camera zooms in on the astronaut as they stumble around, getting their footing.

The astronaut reaches into their pocket and pulls out a flag, which they proceed to push into the surface of the moon. However, instead of planting it firmly into the ground, the flag simply pokes through the moon's skin like a needle through tissue paper.

The camera zooms out as the moon suddenly bursts open like a balloon, releasing a massive amount of gas and debris into space (WHOOSH). The astronaut is left standing on the surface, looking shocked and confused.

Back on Earth, we see a group of sky-gazers watching in amazement as the moon buzzes around the sky like a deflating balloon, powered by its escaping gases (ZZZT).

The camera pans out further as the moon continues to shrink and disappear into space, leaving behind a trail of debris and a stunned astronaut standing alone on the lunar surface.
