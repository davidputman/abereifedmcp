INT./EXT. MOON SURFACE – DAY

A barren lunar plain stretches under a black sky speckled with distant stars.

The camera pans down to reveal a SMALL SPACECRAFT drifting slowly toward the surface.

ACTION
The spacecraft descends, its landing gear touching the dust with a gentle thud.

The ship's DOOR slides open. An ASTRONAUT in a gleaming suit steps out, floating briefly before planting a FLAG into the ground.

A sudden EXPLOSION erupts from the moon’s core, sending a burst of light and gas outward.

ACTION
The MOON itself starts to POP like a balloon, expanding rapidly as it emits bright, swirling GASES.

EXT. EARTH SKY – NIGHT

A group of SKY-WATCHERS in an observatory look up in amazement as the moon hovers, spinning slowly, surrounded by a shimmering halo of gas.

The MOON BOUNCES around the Earth, leaving a trail of glittering vapor that glows like stardust.

CUT TO:

EXT./INT. SPACE – CONTINUOUS

The expanding moon finally bursts completely, dissolving into a cascade of sparkling particles that drift away into the vastness of space.

FADE OUT.
